# KSight

KSight is a user-centered Kubernetes GUI tool, focus on real-world operations rather than Kubernetes resource types.

# Overall Layout

Top: Tabs of Active/Pinned Cluster Connections, Add button to trigger connect cluster from existing KubeConfig or Load From Plaintext KubeConfig / New KubeConfig File (note all saved KubeConfig files should be watched, and ~/.kube Folder is default watched), Think Chrome Tabs, the right side is settings gear to open settings page, design it like VSCode, also extensible for different plugins, each has one namespace

Left Sidebar(icon, narrow, like VSCode icon button at left)
- Vertical Icon Menus: Applications, Operations, Nodes, Resources, Templates, Boards and more extensions (default to open workloads, remember last active menu and menu order in local storage, order could be drag-n-drop adjustable)
- Main Area, varies for each menu
- Right: AI Chatbox and chat histories, it can call K SDK and Operations like k.operation('a').run(dynamic params)

On Most Pages' Main Area:
- Heading Line1: All opened views, if no saved active view, show default view with last filter/group/orders, each View could be closed, and plus button after all opened views, when click it, show dropdown of all saved views with filter, open from Saved Views or create new default view. (Views are are stored global scope, each View includes Filter and GroupBy and OrderBy, has some metadata, include which menu it belongs to, isPinned, isShared[gen shortlink for shared filter to send to any body] when switch between filters, criteria are replaced with current page);
- Body: DataTable:
- Table Heading: 
  - left: Filters
  - right: GroupBy Buttons, View/Hide Columns, Expand All/Collapse button
- Table Body: item list with pagination, could be Groups of item list when it has 2 levels, each item has a checkbox to select, and a checkbox to select all items in current page or all pages, and right side of each item is icon and grouped action buttons, icon actions need hover to show, each item clicked, open a width-adjustable drawer to show item details, (on top right, checkbox to hide managedFields, hidden by default)
Note: add pagination for groups, and inside each group, use virtual scroll list when count too large in one sub-group, each group is collapsable

Footer: Ad-hoc Command Tabs, collapsable, user can click '+' button at end of Tab to Add resource | Run k. command scripts | Pod shell | Pod logs | Pod files | Resource Diff
- When it's Add resource, open the MonacoEditor, yaml , with Apply | Cancel buttons
- When it's k.command scripts, open the typescript MonacoEditor left, Xterm right, with Run | Cancel buttons, right side for showing ad-hoc output, if it's K8S resource, show formatted output like kubectl, resolve the printed columns defined in k8s API
- When it's Pod shell | Pod logs, open the Xterm, similar to VSCode terminal, with split view, add switch container, command shortcut features on top of this special Xterm.
- When it's Pod files, left side is Dir/File tree of this Pod, with top input to switch base dir or exact file or glob file pattern, when clicked, right side is monaco editor to show file content for less than 10MB(adjustable setting) file. user can modify it, backed by Upload/Download using tar like kubectl cp, but impl with golang and wrapped in 'K' ts sdk, and when no file is selected, show two buttons upload/download here, to upload/download files to this pod and current active base dir
- When it's Resource Diff, select left and right, each could be existing resource, or template, or ad-hoc pasted, then open Monaco diff viewer, and when one side is existing resource, allow user to one click to merge or replace changes (ignore metadata name/ns, KGV) and Save to cluster

For Every Yaml Editor View, it has 3 parts, metadata, spec|data etc., status:
- If it's modify resource Editor: hide last-applied-configuration and managedFields, collapse status. if the spec is known type like Deployment, show some quick inputs above, like replicas, image, command, args etc. to avoid find inside the monaco editor
- If it's modify status Editor: hide spec|data, show status, and emphasize edit status can result in unexpected behavior

Built-in Topology Dialog:
In the detail view of any resource type, show root level controller object, and show additional topology button on the root controller object, build kubectl tree like structure, each resource can view its detail or edit yaml, if leaf nodes number > 10 items, show as N more items, click to expand 10 or expand all.

- Body:
 - Computing (show container images/cmds/args, quotas, status, metrics chart of containers, also link non standard resources and devices claims here)
 - Configuration (show configmaps, secrets, one click to edit)
 - Networking (show related k8s service, one click to port-forward)
 - Storage (show related volumes)
- Footer: k8s events, last exit reason, last stop time etc.

workload view，show pod，linked resource and node view，group to owner，kind， log，exec，attach，events，metrics （versions and img versions，one click update version to owner workload） reverse find service and one click forward，ephemeral debug container（showhide daemonsets）

Right: when click and template, show overview info on top, name, description etc., include template params(name, type, default val), actions like share|save|delete|duplicate, and monaco editor for main area, use `~{}` for template params

## Operations

Layout similar to Templates, but each operation click is to show overview and run history, when click edit, show monaco editor of typescript, and run button.
Actions: Run(with params, default to current active cluster), Run in multiple clusters, need double confirm

Saved Operations (Belongs to Operation Menu, each Operation is a typescript running on frontend);

Operations ship with built-in troubleshooting ways:
- General Linux tools: bpftrace strace ，dump mem/stacktrace
- Language specific tools: go pprof, java arthas etc., c++ gdb
- Http/grpc/websocket tracing and debug operation etc.
- K8S operation flows: batch delete res, remove owner ref

Run history and output are saved in local file system

# Tech Requirements

- Use Golang Dynamic Informers to watch needed resources, and use Wails Framework for EventsOn/EventsOff to sync to JS side
- Keep Shadcn-Vue / Pinia / TailwindCSS stack, when you need new common component, Ask me first to offer a draft, if i say continue, you define the component directly
- All TS functions wrapped in window.k as SDK, considering type inference and strong typing. all data from frontend memory maintained by events, and it can also be used in operations, like await k.pods.list({ labelSelector: 'app=nginx' }).first().exec({ command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo hello'] }); await k.resource("apiVersionAndGroup", "SomeCR").get("namespace", "name").util(k.conditionReady or custom predicate); k.update(() => {k.deployment.get("namespace", "name");return updatedDeployment}, maxRetryOnConflictOption); k.patch(jsonPatch); k.createOrUpdate((obj) => { obj.isEmpty() return new Obj; else assigned fields return updatedObj}, maxRetryOnConflictOption); wrap errors, allow err.isNotFound(), err.isConflict(), err.isRateLimited() etc., and err.statusCode, err.message for raw error.
- Be careful of K8S cache mechanism, think utilize stored resourceVersion and local file storage to speed up first init and avoid loading too much data and make pressure on etcd, think best and concise way of modify informer lastVersion, don't trigger full sync when this process restarts, load from local files as much as possible, and keep cache strong consistency
- Use log file to store all sdk mutations and get/list/watch request metadata for verbose log and debug, each log has unique id(operation execution ID, or default UUID when each time this process starts), and store all operation execution history, can link to all SDK run log, and link to operation info
- Each page can mock and run separately, and use dynamic component to register and mount it, this is key to allow Extension mechanism, any one can use shadcn-vue and wrapped "K" sdk to develop KSight extension, make sure the whole project is extensible, also the command+T palette should be extensible and publish to npm registry, think how VSCode/Raycast extension works. For example Security could be a extension, detect all outdated images and dangerous k8s permissions, configs etc. All data layer functions are run in frontend using 'with + Proxy' sandbox, UI components are limited to main project existing components and auto imported to dynamic injected components
- Pages be condense, like IDE style, don't write too many repeated tailwind classes, think abstraction and componentization. don't write svg in code, use lucide icons if possible, if have to use svg, move it to components/icon folder
- Vue/Vue use already auto-import, don't write import statements, if other common module discovered, add to auto-imports and don't write lots of repeated import statements

# Other Requirements

- Don't write too many codes at once, do one small thing at a time, ask me to review and continue
- Be concise and clear, modern and beautiful, don't reinvent wheels, no redundant codes and comments, don't add CSS in vue component if tailwind can do it, think logic and styling and component abstraction, don't repeat.
